# AgriMarketJA

The Consumer Affairs Commission releases a spreadsheet document that shows the prices for over forty (40) commodities at over twenty (20) locations in the Kingston Municipality Area weekly.

## Why do they do this?
- Individuals and businesses buy in bulk and would like to view availability of commodities as well as compare prices at different locations
- Vendors know that prices are publicly compared which discourages price gouging and inconsistency with nearby sellers
- Helps government agencies track inflation and food affordability.
- Empowers farmers and vendors to price their goods competitively and decide where to sell based on market behaviour. 

Unfortunately, most Jamaicans aren't away that this useful document exists.

So meet AgriMarketJA, your digital companion with live price comparison from CAC and weekly tends by market and commodity.
