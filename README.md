# AgriMarketJA
The Consumer Affairs Commission (CAC) in Jamaica publishes a weekly spreadsheet detailing prices for over 40 commodities across more than 20 locations within the Kingston Municipality Area.

## Why is This Information Important?
This data provides significant benefits for various stakeholders:

- For Consumers & Businesses: It enables informed purchasing decisions, allowing individuals and businesses to compare prices and check commodity availability across different locations for bulk buying.
- For Vendors: Public access to pricing data discourages price gouging and promotes competitive and consistent pricing among nearby sellers.
- For Government Agencies: The information is crucial for tracking inflation and assessing food affordability, aiding in economic monitoring and policy-making.
- For Farmers & Suppliers: It empowers them to price their goods competitively and strategically choose selling locations based on real-time market behavior.
